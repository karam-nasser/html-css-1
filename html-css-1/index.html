    <h2>Gematria, Numerology Code</h2>
    <span>Gematria is a numerological system by which letters correspond to numbers. 
        The system, developed by practitioners of Kabbalah, derived from Greek influence.
        <br>
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        In gematria, each letter is represented by a number 
        (for example, A = 1, B = 2, etc.). 
        One can calculate the numerical value of a word by adding together the values of each letter in it. 
        In the realm of decoding, numerological equivalence of words,
        can help practicioners reveal different interpretations. 
        If a wordâ€™s numerical value equals that of another word, 
        a commentator might draw a connection between the words 
        and use the connection for larger conceptual conclusions.
        <br>
        <h3>When It All Began</h3>
       300 B.C. Gematria is predated as far back as ancient Greece.
       With Plato himself being a practioner of the code. 
       <br>
       <h3>Modern Day Use</h3>
       There are many famous examples of Gematria,
       the majority of which come from religious texts.
       Modern beliefs of Gematria are relevant to potential,
       hidden messages from ancient texts.
